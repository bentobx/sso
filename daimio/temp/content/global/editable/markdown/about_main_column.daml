Over the past year, the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario (SSO) developed SOUND OFF as a way of ensuring that young people are included in decision-making about their mental health concerns and are able to take action with their peers to enact change. Too often young people experience significant barriers when trying to communicate their experiences with mental health to friends or family, or even accessing Ontarioâ€™s mental health system. Many of the programs dedicated to youth mental health are either underfunded or completely invisible.

The SOUND OFF program is meant to increase the visibility of youth mental health issues by first collecting the perspectives of youth on mental health and then translating these into specific actions that young people across the province can take to ensure that the conversation not only shifts, but that there are adequate supports as well.
